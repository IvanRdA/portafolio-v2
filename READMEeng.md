# Web Portfolio - Final Version

## Overview:

This project represents the final version of my first web portfolio as a fullstack developer. The project is small and simple, developed solely on the frontend, leveraging the concept of "data mocking" (the project has no backend or database).
The dynamic content of the portfolio is generated using JSON files that contain dictionaries of information susceptible to being dynamic (projects, skills, code snippets, etc.).

Despite being a small project, I have instantiated it in NextJS for future scalability reasons, as I will gradually expand the project's infrastructure as I work on new projects, adding backend and/or database, as well as some extra dependencies for more advanced functionalities.

Regarding the active project dependencies, I have used i18n for multilingual support on the site, TypeScript for static typing purposes, and TailwindCSS for styles (the latter two managed through NextJS).

## Installation and Configuration:

To view the project, simply visit the project's URL: [https://www.ivanr-portafolio.vercel.app](https://www.ivanr-portafolio.vercel.app) as the production deployment has already been completed.
